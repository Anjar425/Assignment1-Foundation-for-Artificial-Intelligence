# Assignment 1: Foundation for Artificial Intelligence

## Question 2 
**Scenario**:  
In Indonesia, cash denominations include both paper money and coins. A customer requests to withdraw all their savings in cash, and the bank must determine the required denominations.

**Denominations**:  
- **Paper Money**: Rp 100,000, Rp 50,000, Rp 20,000, Rp 10,000, Rp 5,000, Rp 2,000  
- **Coins**: Rp 1,000, Rp 500, Rp 200, Rp 100  

**Rules**:  
1. The largest denominations are prioritized first.  
2. Any remaining balance that cannot be cashed must be reported.  
3. Calculate the total number of Paper Money and Coins.  
4. Maximum disbursement amount: Rp 1 billion.  

**Task**:  
Develop a Python program that takes an integer input (customer savings between 0 and 1 billion) and outputs:  
1. The number of each denomination required to fulfill the request.  
2. The total number of Paper Money and Coins.  
3. The remaining balance that cannot be cashed.  


## Question 3  
**Scenario**:  
HR professionals often lack proficiency in analytics and data visualization. To address this gap, Dr. Carla Patalano created an HR-related dataset for the HR Metrics and Analytics course at New England College of Business. This dataset will be used for data analysis and predictive modeling.

**Task**:  
1. **Data Aggregation**  
   - Use Pandas to answer multiple aggregation questions (refer to the provided `.ipynb` file for detailed queries).  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyze the target variable to identify key factors influencing employee terminations, such as reasons, department, and gender.  
   - Create at least five visualizations as part of the EDA process and provide insights from these visualizations.  

3. **Key Analysis Questions**  
   - **Manager-Performance Relationship**: Determine if there is a relationship between an employee's manager and their performance score.  
   - **Recruiting Source Analysis**: Identify the best recruiting sources for minimizing employee termination rates.
